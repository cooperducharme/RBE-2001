 /*
  * A minimal class to control a servo on pin 6.
  * 
  * It uses output compare on Timer4 to control the pulse. The 10-bit Timer4 is set up in Init()
  * with a pre-scaler of 256, so 16 us resolution for the servo position (which is pretty fine, actually).
  * 
  * Upon request, I could figure out how to have 11-bit accuracy, or 8 us.
  * 
  * OCR4D controls the pulse on pin 6 -- THE SERVO MUST BE ON PIN 6! 
  * 
  * OCR4D takes a 10-bit value, but two MSBs are written using a common register (TC4H). 
  * But since a value of 256 corresponds to 4096 us, the high bits will always be 00.
  * 
  * Defaults to a range of 1000 - 2000 us, but can be customized.
